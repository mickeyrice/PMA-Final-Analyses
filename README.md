# PMA-Final-Analyses

For the manuscript based on my thesis (Neural Correlates of Prospective Memory in College Students with Anxiety)

The aim of this manuscript was to examine if increased anxiety levels predicted decreased prospecitve memory performance, and if brain activity, measured from two event-related potentials, could explain this relationship. Based on previous literature, we controlled for gender and age. 

We used regression to test a relationship between prospective memory accuracy and reaction time (Accuracy, RT), anxiety levels (BAI, STAIT, STAIS), and two event-related potential (N300, PP). Once regressions were established, we ran a mediation analysis.

We created graphs and tables to include in the manuscript.
